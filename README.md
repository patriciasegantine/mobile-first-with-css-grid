This is a responsive website and it's my first time using a mobile-first build

- mobile first
- grid layout and flexbox
- menu mobile (burguer) with JS
- responsive
- acessibility

< Inspired by The Net Ninja tutorial - "Mobile-first Resonsive Build" >


=> things to do:

  *smooth scroll
  *close menu when cliking on a link.
